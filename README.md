# quickcourse-claude-test-samples

Sample code repository for the Quick Course Experiments with Claude Code.

## Structure

This repository contains:

- Top-level directories for each chapter (ROOT, LABENV, chapter1, chapter2, chapter3, appendix) containing example code
- A `modules` directory that mirrors the Antora module structure, with `examples` directories that are symbolic links to the top-level chapter directories

This structure allows the examples to be organized by chapter while being accessible through the Antora content source system.
